# Information Security Dictionary
It is the aim of this document to provide an overview over the meanings of commonly used terms in Information Security. The major focus is hereby on the vocabulary used in the Information Security lecture held at the Department of Information Systems at the WWU by Prof. Fischer.

It should provide the full names behind shortcuts and wherever possible or necessary also provide explanations of the item.

To do so, two different entry options exist:
* `entry`: this command takes the shortcut as first parameter and the full name as its second one
* `defentry`: this command works like `entry` with the difference of providing a third parameter for the additional explanation
